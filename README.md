# KeetanDog
Copying the Boston Dynamics Robot Dog and making it significantly worse

# How to set up the library

- Download in a .zip file
- Extract to your documents
- Copy the Leg folder and its contents
- Go to your Arduino IDE folder for libraries (should be in documents laballed "Arduino" then go into the folder to the "Libraries" folder) and paste.
- In the Arduino IDE with Keetan.ino open, upload code to robot with it open. there should be comments throughout the script that should tell you possible concerns.
- Wait for my main mans keetandog to blow up
- Warning: Code won't work
- Oh yeh also ignore the folders keetan1 and robotdog in the main folder of the repo they are old and for some reason didnt delete
